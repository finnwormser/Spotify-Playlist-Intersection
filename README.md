# Spotify-Playlist-Intersection
This notebook creates a playlist with all the songs that appear at least once in the playlists of both the first and the second user (the intersection).  To use, you need to get a secret key from the Spotify developer dashboard. Type in the names or user IDs of the accounts you want to pull from. If the name doesn't work, to get the user ID, click copy link to profile, paste it in your browser, and enter. The user ID is the series of characters at the end of the link, copy this into the input bar in the notebook. It will redirect you to sign in on Spotify. The account you sign in with and allow permissions for will have the playlist of the intersection made.
